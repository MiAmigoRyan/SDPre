		<h1>Hello World!üåèüåçüåé</h1>
		<h2>My name is Ryan.</h2>
		<p>I am just beginign my experience with computer programing. </p>
		<p>As of February 23, 2023 I have an introductory undrstanding of the following languages.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>„Éª HTML</em></li>
			<li><em>„Éª CSS</em></li>
			<li><em>„Éª Java</em></li>
			<li><em>„Éª javascript</em></li>
		</ol>		
		<p>I began my journey November 22, 2022 with The Odin Project. I have nearly completed their foundations course and hope to be finished no later than March 10, 2023.</p>
		<p>I was accepted to and enrolled in the <em><a href="https://turing.edu">Turing</a></em> school of software design <em>Back End</em> program in late December of 2022. I had a friend, Kara, who completed <em>Turing's Front End</em> program, her experience and sucess is what drew me originally to this school. However as I began to engage more with computer programming I began to question wether or not I wanted to dive into Ruby on Rails - the language and framework (respectively) taught by Turing. Additionally the <strong>SEVEN MONTH</strong> duration of the program intimidated me. Ultimately I dropped out of Turing and have enrolled in a Full Stack program with <em><a href="https://skilldistillery.com">Skill Distillery (SD)</a></em>. This course is a mere <strong>FOUR MONTHS</strong>. Another leading factor in my deciding to enroll with <em>SD</em> is the stack, Java and Javascript.</p>
		<p>Thus far I am enjoying Java and Javascript. I have found patirciluarly, as a static language, Java is requiring of me a level of precision that I am not accustomed to.</p>
